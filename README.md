# BinaryTreeOperations

The program allows inserting nodes into a binary tree and all operations (inorder,postorder,preoder) + printing the tree in ASCII mode.

Binary Tree operations. This Program is created by Turcan Catalin in its entirety. This allows traversals/searching/deletion and printing.
I do allow my code to be copied, but the original source must be specified in the code/application, otherwise law may be applied.
